{"name":"DesignCrowd Project Brief Redesign","tagline":"","body":"## DesignCrowd Project Brief Redesign.\r\n### Task\r\nYour task is to improve the design of our [existing brief page](http://jobs.designcrowd.com/job.aspx?id=293200).\r\nThe current brief page is an old page on DesignCrowd and we want to give it an upgrade. We want to focus on improving the design so it fits with the look and feel on our homepage ([http://www.designcrowd.com](http://www.designcrowd.com)) in addition to improving how we communicate elements on the page.\r\n\r\n### Key Objectives\r\n* Improve the look and feel\r\n* Make it easier for designers to understand the status of the project (open, closed etc.), how many\r\ndesigns received and how many days left.\r\n* Increase the prominence on amount of money on offer\r\n* Enhance the prominence and look of the call to action to submit design\r\n* Deliver either a PhotoShop (PSD) or implemented HTML as a final deliverable\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Tasks Completed\r\n* Analysed design and identified key areas for improvement\r\n* Completed lo-fi wireframes on paper to establish a direction for new design\r\n* Mocked up high detailed visual designs in Photoshop for guidance\r\n* Built out frontend using existing DesignCrowd assets where possible\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nDue to time constraints:\r\n* Testing and development was limited to just one browser - Chrome\r\n* Media Queries are not supported in this build. The build was tested at 1170px only.\r\n* No JavaScript functionality was implemented as the task was focused more on design & UX.\r\n* A design for a signed out user exists but there is no markup to accompany it.\r\n\r\n### Designs\r\n#### Signed In:\r\n![](http://gilesbutler.co.uk/clients/dc/Screens/Brief-page-signed-in.jpg)\r\n#### Signed Out:\r\n![](http://gilesbutler.co.uk/clients/dc/Screens/Brief-page-signed-out.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Progress\r\nTasks & Analysis\r\n![Tasks](http://www.gilesbutler.co.uk/clients/dc/Screens/tasks.jpg)\r\nWireframing\r\n![](http://www.gilesbutler.co.uk/clients/dc/Screens/wireframes.jpg)\r\nMarkup\r\n![](http://www.gilesbutler.co.uk/clients/dc/Screens/markup.jpg)\r\nNo Styles\r\n![](http://www.gilesbutler.co.uk/clients/dc/Screens/no-styles.jpg)\r\nStart of Styles\r\n![](http://www.gilesbutler.co.uk/clients/dc/Screens/styling-1.jpg)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
